## 🗺️ Project Roadmap & Development Steps

### 1. Setup & Configuration
- Initialize Next.js app with TypeScript
- Connect to Sanity CMS for content management
- Configure environment variables securely (`.env.local`)
- Create reusable Sanity client (`lib/sanity/client.ts`)

### 2. Data Modeling & Schemas
- Define product schema in Sanity (`sanity/schemaTypes/product.ts`)
- Include fields for product name, price, description, images, slug, and metadata

### 3. Product Listing Page
- Fetch products from Sanity using GROQ queries
- Display product cards in a responsive grid (`src/components/ProductCard.tsx`)
- Implement product types and props for type safety

### 4. Product Detail Page with Dynamic Routing
- Create dynamic route `/products/[id].tsx`
- Use `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` to generate pages for each product
- Show full product details including large image, description, price, and related info

### 5. Styling & UI Enhancements
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling and layout
- Ensure accessibility and responsive design
- Add hover states and interactive elements on product cards

### 6. Deployment
- Setup Netlify for deployment
- Configure environment variables on Netlify dashboard
- Use `.gitignore` to keep credentials safe locally
- Deploy and test live site thoroughly
